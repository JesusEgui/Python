Iterating through a string and printing each character:

for char in 'exciting adventure':
    print(char)
Checking if a name is in a list of invited guests:

invited_guests = ['Kate', 'Adam', 'Kerry', 'Joe', 'Anne', 'Marie']
name = input('What is your name? ')
if name in invited_guests:
    print('Welcome!')
else:
    print('You are not invited!')
Checking if a name is not in a list of invited guests:

invited_guests = ['Kate', 'Adam', 'Kerry', 'Joe', 'Anne', 'Marie']
name = input('What is your name? ')
if name not in invited_guests:
    print('You are not invited!')
else:
    print('Welcome!')

for char in 'happy message':
    print(char)
    
    
invited_guests = ['Kate', 'Adam', 'Kerry', 'Joe', 'Anne', 'Marie']
name = input('What is your name?')
if name in invited_guests:
    print('Welcome!')
else:
    print('You are not invited!')
    
    
invited_guests = ['Kate', 'Adam', 'Kerry', 'Joe', 'Anne', 'Marie']
name = input('What is your name?')
if name not in invited_guests:
    print('You are not invited!')
