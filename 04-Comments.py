Exercise 1:

# Exercise 1: Fix the code to print the sum of var1 and var2 as integers.

# Note that the variables are strings, not numbers!
var1 = '23'
var2 = '54'

# Convert var1 and var2 to integers and print their sum.
sum_result = int(var1) + int(var2)
print(sum_result)
Exercise 2:

# Exercise 2: Debug the code to print the hidden message.

print('hello')
# print('hidden message') <- This line should not be commented out.
print('world')  # Add a new line to print 'world'.
