Exercise 1:

# Exercise 1: Calculate the total cost of purchasing multiple items.

item_price = 15  # Price of a single item
quantity = 4     # Number of items to purchase

# Calculate the total cost and store it in the 'total_cost' variable.
total_cost = item_price * quantity

# Print the result.
print("The total cost of purchasing", quantity, "items is:", total_cost)
Solution 1:

The total cost of purchasing 4 items is: 60


Exercise 2:

# Exercise 2: Calculate the area of a triangle.

base_length = 10  # Length of the base of the triangle
height = 6         # Height of the triangle

# Calculate the area of the triangle and store it in the 'area' variable.
area = 0.5 * base_length * height

# Print the result.
print("The area of the triangle is:", area)
Solution 2:

The area of the triangle is: 30.0
