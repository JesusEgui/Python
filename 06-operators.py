Exercise 1:

# Exercise 1: Calculate the area of a rectangle with given length and width.

length = 8
width = 5

# Calculate the area of the rectangle and store it in the 'area' variable.
area = length * width

# Print the result.
print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)
Exercise 2:

Exercise 2: Calculate the total cost of buying multiple items.

item_price = 12  # Price of a single item
quantity = 10    # Number of items to purchase
tax_rate = 0.08  # Sales tax rate (8%)

# Calculate the total cost, including tax, and store it in the 'total_cost' variable.
total_cost = (item_price * quantity) * (1 + tax_rate)

# Print the result.
print("The total cost, including tax, is:", total_cost)
